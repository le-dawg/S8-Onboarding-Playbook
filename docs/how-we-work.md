# How we work
{: .no_toc .fw-700 }

As solutioneers at Solution8, we have a wealth of opportunities to both learn and deepen our expertise of good design practices of software systems (our other work nonwithstanding), as well as teach and share these practices to fellow Solution8 team members and our clients.

## Sharing with and learning from our teammates

More brains are better than one, so we must take every opportunity possible to share with and learn from others on our team. We meet several times every week to talk through team developments or learnings, share work, or run a retro together. 

**Critiques and share-outs**  
We aim to regularly share in-progress work for feedback and to learn from one another. Sometimes these are more formal critiques, and sometimes they’re just to share something interesting that might be useful to others.

## Bringing a fresh systems thinking perspective to Solution8 

Solution8 loosely (at the moment) follows [Sociocracy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NwQ3N9Zzy0O_KmprdwtAovEwZDGT3TeCdr9rggzu-zI/edit?ts=5d44d762#heading=h.8oxflvtts2qi) where you can lend your time and expertise to help improve the organization. You can easily find these groups by searching “c-” for committees, “g-” for guilds, and “wg-” for working groups in Slack.

Here are some examples of the committees, guilds, and working groups designers have joined or contributed to in the past:

**[#c-tdr](https://trussworks.slack.com/archives/CFAAT6D25)**: Amanda and Jesse (our former head of design) both managed the TDR committee, shepherding decision prototypes to acceptance (and sometimes rejection). A few TDRs have been explicitly for the design practice, including ones that founded the practice ([🔒 0021](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TAotcsdTZEyfSXr0O4K6GnanBlApZ4xnL4-OnangU9s/edit#heading=h.7qctexvsqsup)), made a11y training available ([🔒 0083](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cWWOaqDxzbk44k_42kLcUfueRu8PgiuWDrDO_nsqu9w/edit#heading=h.mwzeyri1eozi)), and established section 508 training ([🔒 0116](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12EFlY3Xk1q32klWI978FwCE-avKNmZZu187yA-qKyDg/edit#heading=h.7qctexvsqsup)).

**[#g-frontend](https://slack.com/app_redirect?channel=g-frontend)**: Josh, James, Shauna and others from the design practice have participated in this guild which provides a collaborative space to learn and discuss best frontend development practices.

**[#g-accessibility](https://trussworks.slack.com/archives/CMBPU13FX)**: An excellent example of a cross-practice guild for all who want to improve our individual, project, and company-level capabilities to produce highly accessible software and practices.

**[#g-content](https://trussworks.slack.com/archives/CJGP8SDPF)**: Sees mostly designers and a fair number of other practices gather to grow and bolster our content design capabilities. They also are a great example of our [🔒 Guild Shared Leadership Model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NwQ3N9Zzy0O_KmprdwtAovEwZDGT3TeCdr9rggzu-zI/edit?ts=5d44d762#heading=h.8oxflvtts2qi).

**[#wg-covidwriting](https://slack.com/app_redirect?channel=wg-covidwriting)**: In the early throes of the pandemic, Ryan B and Kate both jumped in to help on a short-term project to formalize and publish our best practices on distributed work.

## Representing design in sales scopings and proposals

We are fortunate to have a business development team that prioritizes practitioner participation and input in the sales process. All scoping calls with prospective commercial clients include a member of the design team so that we can ensure someone from the practice can vet the opportunity, understand the needs of the client, help determine staffing, and assist with writing the proposal.

Dawid, Kasper and Martin helped design a [streamlined diagram](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVIgwqhQ4=/?moveToWidget=3458764638066809263&cot=14) that details every client and internal touchpoint from the prospect stage to getting the deal signed. The [Involving Solution8 team members in Sales Playbook]() doesn't yet exist - it should outline exactly when and how solutioneers get brought into the sales process, what the expectations are, and the current list of folks who are designated to assist with this effort. Since we are stiull lacking repeatability of our workloads, there are multiple solutions in the air, from a Sales Engineering MCP to a customGPT to what the diagram says. This needs to be finalized in the coming weeks.

## Working with teammates and clients on projects

There is no “typical” project here at Solution8 (yet), so there is no “typical” solutioneer handbook to run one, but there are some practices I hold near and dear, which are partially formalized below:

**Team norming**  
Every new project is a new problem to solve and potentially a brand new mix of people to solve it with — which is why we care so deeply about team norming and building a foundation of trust.

- **BICEPS:** Understand what is important to each person working on the project and what motivates us.
- **Superpowers and kryptonite:** Understand each person’s self-identified strengths and areas for improvement.
- **Contribute, lead, learn:** Understand the work areas each person wants to contribute to, lead, and learn more about.

In addition to these activities, I consider it critically important to for the entire internal team to know how decisions will be made, who will be involved, and how 
they will be documented. In the past, I worked in envs with a robust practice of using [decision records](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record) to document decisions on both a company and project level. Given the speed at which changesd aqnd work happens, this is not something that is practical, but the need for documentation is there, no doubt. This might turn out to become an internal product. TBD.

**Discovery and framing**  
We regularly push clients to include an Opportunity Mapping (some call it Discovery and Framing) period at the start of each project to ensure we are all aligned on user needs, business goals, and stakeholder priorities before we settle on a solution. If there is a common thread in almost all of our projects, it’s this, and as the experts, we’re often leading the charge on this effort, which can be challenging, as the majority of the world is not prepared for structured approaches (well, most likely not willing ot pay). 

In a nutshell, Opportunity Mapping is a simplified, streamlined and compressed version of the [Double Diamond Process](https://www.designpsykologi.dk/hvad-er-double-diamond):

```
1. Understand the problem space
    - Onboard client to mindset
    - Align on access and tooling
    - Have a `pre-mortem` internally and talk through anti-goals
    - Review past research and identify assumptions and gaps
    - Map current workflows
    - Map stakeholders and their scale of influence

2. Conduct stakeholder and user research
    - Write interview scripts
    - Recruit, schedule, and conduct interviews
    - Synthesize information (create/update user archetypes, user needs, pain points, journey maps, service blueprints, etc)
    - Collaborate with stakeholders to prioritize needs and create experiments roadmap to test ideas

3. Experiment with potential solutions
    - Run test sessions with stakeholders and users to validate solutions rapidly
    - Design low-fidelity prototypes to test with stakeholders and users
    - Synthesize findings and share recommendations
    - Create an outcome-based roadmap and project plan to move forward
```

As you can tell, this is a very detailed approach that, given the hype and magical expectations in software, simply doesn't work yet. Opportunity Mapping is simpler, speaks into business value and cost first, demonstrates value within days of kickoff (or even before) and relies heavily on visual aids to communicate. [Find details here] (https://airadgivning.sharepoint.com/sites/AIRdgivning/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FAIRdgivning%2FShared%20Documents%2FBusiness%20Consulting%2FBusiness%20Consulting%20Workshops&viewid=82984b62%2Dc2a6%2D4eb2%2Dab3c%2D22d797fdf0c3&FolderCTID=0x012000364B12E1DBF10041B035055D2BF325C8).

While every project approaches this work a little bit differently, there’s value in having a shared library of resources to pull from. We have several Miroboards, GitHub Repos, Word Documents (!) in Sharepoint with our procedures all over the place. easy-to-copy templates for many of the activities listed above. Some [resources](../resources/resources) I have brought over from the past can be found in the Resources section of this handbook.

## Sharing good design practices company-wide

In the life cycle of Solution8, solutioneering is a relatively new practice, so when an opportunity presents itself to share solutioneering practices and work with the entire company, we take it. 

Most Friday Afternoons, we conduct our Firday Forums. Usually, the process is fixed and takes around 90 minutes, which leaves a 30 minute slot open for any team member to present on a topic to the rest of the Solution8 team.
