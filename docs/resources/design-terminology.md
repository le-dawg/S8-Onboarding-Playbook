To set a foundation for our discussions with each other and our clients, here is a list of terminology. This is not exhaustive at all, and we should consider having an agent listen in to how we speak to keep addingh to it.

|:------------|:-------------------|
| Persona (not AI)    | An output of synthesized user research findings that describes an archetypal end-user and their goals, characteristics, pains, and needs. |

|Service blueprint| A diagram that displays the customer experience, their touch points within a service, and a detailed look into the people, technology, and processes that support that experience. There are several swimlanes in a service blueprint separated into the frontstage (what impacts the customer directly) and the backstage (activities that a customer does not see but support the experience).|
| Insight|A synthesized piece of research based on data and / or observation that explains the user's context, dilemma, why this is a problem, and an ideal.|
| Sketches|Sketches are quick drawings on paper used to flesh out concepts to see if they are viable. Not to be confused with Sketch software which is used for wireframes or design assets.|
| Wireframe| Wireframes are like a blueprint of the product and features before visual design is applied, showing how interactions and user journey would play out. Works best on a Whiteboard.|
| Prototype| Prototype could mean clickable wireframes, clickable design comps, or an fully interactive lovable app that demonstrates the interaction as understood by our team.|
| Usability testing|A method of evaluating a product by testing it with target users and observing how they use it|
