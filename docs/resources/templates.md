# Templates
{: .no_toc .fw-700 }

We have a growing collection of templates at our disposal for use across different aspects of projects, not just for code. As with our toolset, these templates aren’t set in stone, they are a great starting point for methodologies, sample templates, design patterns, and more. We will continue to update this section with more templates as they become more solidified in our practice.

## Methods for Projects and Workshops

**[Project Toolkit: Exercises and Methods for Working on Projects with People](https://trussworks.github.io/project-toolkit/docs/how-to-retro.html)** - I’ve used this set of methods that outline possible Discovery, Creativity and Decision-making activities. Each method provides the what, why, and when to use as well as a detailed explanation of the process for running it.
